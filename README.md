# HiSPARC ... PhD Thesis

These are the source files for my PhD thesis. The full thesis can be built by
compiling the `thesis.tex` file. On a UNIX this can be done by exectuing the
`make.command` file.


## Compiling chapters

Using the `make_chapters.command` individual chapter pdfs can easily be
created. This required arara to be installed, which required Java. Additionally
a custom rule is used, this need to be installed in the arara rules directory.
