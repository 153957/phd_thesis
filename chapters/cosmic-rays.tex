\chapter{Cosmic rays}
\label{ch:cosmic-rays}

Cosmic rays are highly energetic particles from extraterrestrial sources.
This can be any kind of particle.


\subsection{Current state}

Possible anisotropies at very high energies. High energy spectrum
getting more data, but not completely in agreement (due to hotspots,
models or calibrations?). Work is being done to better identify the
contributions to the spectrum from the different kinds of particles.
Very model dependent analyses.


\subsection{Experiments}

There are several very large experiments currently in operation that are
working on the frontier of cosmic-ray research.

The Pierre Auger Observatory (http://www.auger.org), located in
Argentina, is a large ground-based detector using multiple detection
methods in conjunction. Cherenkov water tanks are used to detect charged
particles (leptons) as they pass through the detector. Fluorescence
telescopes are used to look for ultra-violet light in the atmosphere.
Fluorescence occurs in atmospheric nitrogen which is exited by the 
extensive air shower. Finally radio antennae are used to detect the
radio signal produced when the positively and negatively charged
particles in the air shower are separated by the magnetic field. A
similar project exists in the Northern hemisphere called the Telescope
Array.

IceCube (http://icecube.wisc.edu), located in Antarctica, is a neutrino
telescope. Neutrinos pass through most matter because of their low
interaction cross sections. In order to detect the neutrinos IceCube
uses Earth as a detector. IceCube uses \pmts buried \SI{2}{\kilo\meter}
deep in the ice of Antarctica to detect the Cherenkov light caused by
muons that are created by neutrinos passing through the Earth.
Additionally a part called IceTop sits on top of the ice ... detect
atmospheric muons etc.. A similar project called KM3Net is currently
being deployed/build in the Northern hemisphere.

Large area detectors are required to detect the rare very-high-energy
cosmic rays. In figure (spectrum) the flux of primary cosmic rays of
specific energies can be seen. 

The Auger Observatory (and others?) has been operating for over
\SI{10}{\year}. Cosmic rays with energies exceeding
\SI{57}{\exa\electronvolt} have been detected. Why do they use 57 EeV?

\subsection{\hisparc}

The \hisparc project aims to contribute to cosmic ray research by
creating a large network of detectors. Currently the largest distance
between two stations is \SI{1000}{\kilo\meter}.
