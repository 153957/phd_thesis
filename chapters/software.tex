\section{\github}

Our code has transitioned from bazaar to \git, a different distributed
version control system. This made it possible to use the service \github
to host our projects. \github provides a web-interface to manage
projects, keep track of issues, and manage pull requests.

When we were using Bazaar our repositories were hosted on a Nikhef
server, this made it difficult for others to participate and contribute.
On \github the software has been open sourced and can be downloaded with
a single click, on any system.

\github also provides webpage hosting of static pages for repositories,
called \github Pages. We use it to host software documentation and
compiled version of the teaching materials, for which the sources are
also on \github.


\section{Structure}

Since the code can now be easily accessed by anyone we cleaned up the
code to be more consistent and conform to a coding style. For \python we
try to conform to Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 8 - Style Guide for
Python Code.

\section{\hisparc Public Database}

\subsection{\api}

In order to make interactive applications (see \jsparc) we needed to make
access to all kinds of data easy. To facilitate this an \api has been
added to the Public Database. The \api consists of a number of urls that
return data in the form of a JSON (Javscript Object Notation). For
example a list of \hisparc stations can be retrieved via
\url{http://data.hisparc.nl/api/stations/}, the result is:

\begin{verbatim}
[
    {"name": "St. Nicolaaslyceum",
     "number": 2},
    {"name": "Het Amsterdams Lyceum",
     "number": 3},
    {"name": "Chr. Sch. Gem. Buitenveldert",
     "number": 5},
    {"name": "Bern. Nieuwetijt Coll. (Damstede)",
     "number": 6},
    {"name": "Joke Smit College (ROC)",
     "number": 7},
    ...
    {"name": "Karlsruher Institut f√ºr Technologie",
     "number": 70001}
]
\end{verbatim}

A list of all possible urls can be found at \url{http://data.hisparc.nl/api/}.

Functions have been added to both \sapphire and \jsparc to access the
\api. These take care of constructing the urls and converting the json to a
sensible format for the programming language language.


\subsection{Event Summary Database}

Derived database with certain analyses applied, as explained later. Also
coincidences already found, next; automated reconstructions


\section{\sapphire}


\subsection{\pypi}

\sapphire has been made available for easy installation via the Python
Package Index (\pypi).


\subsection{Clusters}

Using the \api \sapphire has access to the \gps coordinates of all
stations. For stations that have submitted their detector positions,
those are available as well. This makes it easy to setup a cluster with
any selection of \hisparc stations. This can be used for simulations.
Imaginary stations can be added to plan future station locations.

\subsection{\corsika}

Reading \corsika output, convert to \hdf and use for simulations.


\subsection{Refactored simulations}

The simulation section of \sapphire has been completely rewritten
working together with dr. David Fokkema and Hans Montanus. Works with
\corsika data, more consistent output that can eb analysed the same way
as real \hisparc data (except that the input is also known).


\subsection{Data quality}

\todo{Write code to determine data quality.}


\subsection{Code testing}

Travis CI, Coveralls
