\section{Positions}

\subsection{\gps Self-Survey}

Two \gps antennae separated by \SI{2}{\meter} are used by station 501
and station 510. Each station performed a self-survey with its own \gps
and one with the \gps of the other station to test the accuracy.
 
\begin{verbatim}
GPS s510
s510  1412347130	52.3558955	4.9509864	54.59
s501  1414406502	52.3558990	4.9509880	57.65

GPS s501
s501  1412347557	52.3558800	4.9510065	55.40
s510  1414406952	52.3558859	4.9510083	57.39
\end{verbatim}

Difference of \SI{1.}{\centi\meter}.


\section{Timing}

\subsection{\gps timestamp, electronics}

When considering coincidences between stations the accuracy of the
timing is crucial. Similar to the offsets between detectors in a
station, offsets between stations have been found. These can be caused
by different detector cable lengths, \gps antennae cable length, and
possibly something in the electronics of the \hisparc box.

Determining the station offset requires many coincidences. The number of
coincidences between stations is inversely correlated to the the
distance between them. Just as the time difference distribution between
detectors the station time difference is dominated by time differences
due to the arrival direction of the showers. This time difference
increases with distance $\Delta t = r * \sin{\theta}$.

             width of the distribution is caused by the distance between
             stations and showers under angles.}

             width of the distribution here is caused by \gps accuracy.
             The reason for two distributions is that at some point in
             the period the \gps antennas were switched between the two
             stations.}
