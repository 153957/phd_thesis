\section{Detector design}

The scintillator detector consists of two main components which perform the
detection. The scintillator, which emits light as charged particles pass
through it, and the Photomultiplier tube which converts the scintillation
photons into an electric signal.

The scintillator is a cuboid of \SI[product-units=power]{100 x 50 x
2}{\centi\meter} made from BC-408 \cite(ref:bc408). The BC-408 material was
chosen for its good timing properties and light output for charged particles.

The Photomultiplier tube (PMT) (\cite{et:pmt}, also ref hamamatsu) is a small
(?) diameter PMT that matches with the thickness of the scintillator.

Besides these the detector construction consists of several other components.
An isosceles triangle light guide, which is glued to the scintillator using
Optical Cement (\cite{bc600}). A little adapter piece is attached to the square
end of the triangle with Optical Cement and the round window of the \pmt with
optical tape. This construction is wrapped in thin, \SI{30}{\micro\meter},
aluminium foil with patches of thicker, ??, aluminium foil at the corners of
the scintillator, to prevent the sharp edges from piercing the thin foil. This
is then wrapped in thick, ??, light tight black pond foil to keep light out and
protect the aluminium foil from outside influences.
