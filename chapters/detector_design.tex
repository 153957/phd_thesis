\section{Detector design}

The scintillator detector consists of two main components which perform
the detection. The scintillator, which emits light as particle traverse
it, and the Photomultiplier tube which converts the scintillation
photons into an electric signal. The scintillator is a cuboid of
\SI[product-units=power]{100 x 50 x 2}{\centi\meter} made from BC-408
\cite(ref:bc408). That material was chosen for its good timing
properties and light output for charged particles.


Most important parts:

- scintillator (\cite{bc408})
- PMT (\cite{et:pmt})

Extra parts:

- light guide (isosceles triangle)
- Little block
- Al foil
- Pond foil
- Black Tape
- Optical Cement (\cite{bc600})
- Optical Tape
